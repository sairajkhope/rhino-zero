# About

## Vision & Mission

I am a technologist and innovator focused on designing meaningful interactions between humans and intelligent systems. My work explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, and human psychology to create technologies that enhance human capabilities rather than replace them.

Through my projects, I aim to develop solutions that address real human needs, build trust in emerging technologies, and create more intuitive ways for people to benefit from advances in AI and robotics.

## Research Focus

My research and development work spans several interconnected domains:

- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Creating systems that complement human creativity and problem-solving
- **Trust in Autonomous Systems**: Developing interfaces that make complex AI decisions transparent and understandable
- **Adaptive Interaction**: Building technology that responds to individual needs and preferences
- **Assistive Robotics**: Applying robotics and AI to healthcare and accessibility challenges

## Projects

My portfolio includes several innovative platforms that explore different facets of human-technology interaction:

### AI Companions & Tools
- **Robin**: A collaborative AI system that extends human creativity through natural conversation
- **Pal**: An ambient AI assistant designed to provide help with minimal friction
- **Creator**: A co-creative system that amplifies human creativity in multiple domains

### Robotics & Autonomous Systems
- **OnTheProwl**: A pioneering social robot for building trust in autonomous vehicles
- **OnTheProwl v2**: An enhanced platform with advanced perception and communication capabilities
- **Safe.t**: A precision robotic system with applications in healthcare and accessibility

## Approach

My work is guided by several core principles:

- **Human-Centered Design**: Technology should adapt to human needs, not the reverse
- **Thoughtful Integration**: The best technology often feels invisible until needed
- **Ethical Innovation**: Developing AI and robotics with careful consideration of societal impact
- **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration**: Combining insights from technology, psychology, design, and other fields

## Background

With a background spanning robotics, artificial intelligence, user experience design, and cognitive psychology, I bring a multidisciplinary perspective to creating technologies that meaningfully enhance how people live and work.

## Connect

I'm always interested in collaborations, discussions about emerging technologies, and opportunities to apply these innovations to new challenges. Feel free to reach out to discuss potential partnerships or share your thoughts on the future of human-AI interaction.
