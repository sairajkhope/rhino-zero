# Hello! 👋

I'm a product designer and creative technologist crafting experiences at the sweet spot where human-centered design meets cutting-edge tech. Think of me as someone who turns "what if?" into "what's next?" – especially when it comes to AI, robotics, and interactive experiences.

## The Journey So Far

My path has led me through some exciting territories:
- **Alongside** – Building the future of human-AI interaction through social robotics
- **Ontheprowl** - Envisioning a better way of experiencing wildlife & nature
- **Lifespark Technologies** – Creating healthcare innovations that matter
- **Hyperloop India** – Leading India's first hyperloop pod design team

Formally trained at BITS Pilani, Goa, but mostly shaped by curiosity and countless prototypes.

## What I Do

I play in the spaces between pixels and reality:

- 🎨 Product & UX Design (Both bits and atoms)
- 🛠 Hardware Systems Engineering
- 💻 Digital Experience Design
- ⚡️ Brand & Design Systems
- 🚀 Rapid Prototyping & Creative Direction

## How I Think

I believe the best technology feels like magic but works like a friend. My approach? Mix equal parts design thinking and technical know-how, add a dash of artistic flair, and serve with a side of user delight.

Every project is a story waiting to be told through thoughtful interactions and meaningful experiences.

## Let's Create Something

Got an idea that lives at the intersection of ambitious and exciting? I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that push the envelope of what's possible. Whether it's designing the next generation of human-AI interactions or prototyping new ways to experience technology, I'm all ears.
