# Creator (by Alongside)

## Overview

Imagine an AI teammate that doesn't just wait for instructions but proactively jumps into action, becoming an actual asset rather than another app to manage. Creator is a collaborative AI assistant built specifically for product teams, seamlessly integrating into your workflow, and yes—finally freeing you from app-switching hell

## Problem Statement

Traditional AI tools are like interns on their first day: eager but clueless, needing constant oversight, reminders, and context resetting. Current tools lack autonomy, can't handle complex tasks independently, and have memory shorter than your attention span on a Monday morning.

## Design Philosophy

Our philosophy was simple—less babysitting, more delegating. We designed Creator to act as a genuine teammate who autonomously tackles tasks, remembers context, and injects just enough personality to feel natural. If AI could fetch coffee, Creator probably would.
