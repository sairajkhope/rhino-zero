# OnTheProwl

## Overview

OnTheProwl is a pioneering social robot designed to build trust in autonomous vehicles through intuitive human-vehicle communication. Developed in 2020, this platform addresses one of the key challenges in autonomous vehicle adoption: human comfort with and trust in self-driving technology.

## Core Technologies

- Anthropomorphic communication interface
- Predictive intent signaling
- Emotion recognition and response system
- Transparent decision communication

## Research Findings

Our initial deployment of OnTheProwl demonstrated:
- Significant reduction in passenger anxiety during autonomous rides
- Improved understanding of vehicle decision-making
- Increased willingness to use autonomous vehicles again
- Higher ratings of perceived safety compared to standard autonomous vehicles

## Design Approach

OnTheProwl's design is based on extensive research in human psychology and trust-building. Rather than hiding the complexity of autonomous systems, we created an interface that makes vehicle decision-making accessible and understandable to passengers.

## Impact

OnTheProwl has contributed to the field of human-robot interaction by demonstrating how social robots can serve as intermediaries between complex autonomous systems and human users, creating experiences that feel safe, predictable, and trustworthy even in high-stakes environments like transportation.

The insights gained from this initial platform led to the development of our enhanced OnTheProwl v2 system in 2021.
