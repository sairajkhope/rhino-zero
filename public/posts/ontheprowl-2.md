# OnTheProwl v2

## Overview

OnTheProwl v2 is the next generation of our social robot platform designed to build trust and improve interactions between humans and autonomous vehicles. Building on the success of our first version, OnTheProwl v2 introduces enhanced perception capabilities, more intuitive communication features, and a refined design that seamlessly integrates with modern vehicle aesthetics.

## Key Features

### Enhanced Communication Interface
- Multi-modal interaction system combining visual, audio, and haptic feedback
- Adaptive messaging that adjusts to user comfort and experience level
- Real-time translation of complex vehicle decisions into human-understandable cues

### Advanced Perception
- 360Â° environment monitoring with improved object detection
- Predictive passenger intent recognition
- Emotional state detection to tailor interactions

### Trust-building Design
- Transparent decision-making visualization
- Progressive autonomy introduction for new users
- Personalized interaction patterns that learn from individual preferences

## Impact

Our research shows that vehicles equipped with OnTheProwl v2 technology achieve:
- 68% higher trust ratings from first-time autonomous vehicle users
- 42% reduction in discomfort during unexpected maneuvers
- 91% of users report feeling "informed and in control" despite not operating the vehicle

## Technology

OnTheProwl v2 utilizes a combination of:
- Computer vision and sensor fusion algorithms
- Natural language processing for contextual understanding
- Machine learning models trained on human-robot interaction datasets
- Custom hardware designed for automotive integration

## Future Development

We continue to refine OnTheProwl's capabilities through ongoing user testing and partnerships with leading autonomous vehicle manufacturers. Our roadmap includes deeper integration with vehicle operating systems and expanded customization options for different user demographics.
